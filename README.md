## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:

Loading the dataset

### STEP 2:

Split the dataset into training and testing

### STEP 3:

Create MinMaxScalar objects ,fit the model and transform the data.

### STEP 4:

Build the Neural Network Model and compile the model.

### STEP 5:

Train the model with the training data.

### STEP 6:

Plot the performance plot

### STEP 7:

Evaluate the model with the testing data.
